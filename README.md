### Overview

This project is a simplified front-end implementation of Google's homepage, created as part of a web development learning exercise. The goal is to create a functional website with HTML and CSS that emulates the look and feel of Google Search, Image Search, and Advanced Search. Users can interact with the pages to perform actual searches by submitting data through forms, utilizing Google’s URL query parameters.

I used oogle's inspect tool to closely replicate the visual and functional design. 

### Features
1. Three Pages:

* Google Search (index.html): The main search page, allows users to perform regular  Google searches.
* Google Image Search: A page for searching Google Images.
* Google Advanced Search: A page for performing advanced searches with multiple fields.

2. Navigation:

* Each page includes navigation links in the upper-right corner to switch between the three pages.

3. Functional Search:

* Users can input queries and submit them to Google’s search engine.
* Queries generate results based on the appropriate GET parameters.

4. Design Elements:

* Centered search bar with rounded corners.
* Centered “Google Search” and “I’m Feeling Lucky” buttons styled to resemble Google’s layout.
* A blue “Advanced Search” button with white text on the Advanced Search page.


5. Advanced Search Options:

* Four fields allow users to:
* Search for pages with all specified words.
* Search for pages with an exact phrase.
* Search for pages with any of several words.
* Exclude pages containing certain words.
* "I'm Feeling Lucky" Button:
Redirects users directly to the first search result, bypassing the results page.
